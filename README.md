# Neural Network From Scratch

## About

This project is an implementation of a [Machine Learning Module](https://github.com/barondebajit/mlmodule) made from scratch.

**Scratch** in this project means using `Python` without the use of any external Machine Learning Libraries. This means libraries like Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow are not used in this project. The only 2 modules used here are `pandas` for data handling and `numpy` for its utilization of vectorization and compatibility with pandas.
