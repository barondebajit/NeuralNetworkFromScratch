# Neural Network From Scratch

## About

This project is an implementation of a [Machine Learning Module](https://github.com/barondebajit/mlmodule) made from scratch.

**Scratch** in this project means using `Python` without the use of any external Machine Learning Libraries. This means libraries like Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow are not used in this project. The only 2 modules used here are `pandas` for data handling and `numpy` for its utilization of vectorization and compatibility with pandas.

## Implementation

The implementation of the module is provided in the `Implementation.ipynb` file. It works on a toy dataset `toy_dataset.csv` that contains different features of a person - _City_, _Gender_, _Age_ and _Income_ and whether they have an _Illness_. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. You can view it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlolepelaars/toy-dataset).

The preprocessing of the dataset, model selection with layers with appropriate optmizers and loss functions was all handled with classes and functions available in **mlmodule**.

## Aim

This project was done to implement some of the core machine learning concepts I learned myself. It also aimed to showcase my understanding of the Python Programming Language and some of the most necessary concepts of programming like Object Oriented Programming.
